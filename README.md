PDF Annotation Tool
This project is a web-based PDF annotation tool built with Next.js, tailwindcss and pdf-lib library. It allows users to upload, annotate, and export PDFs with highlights, underlines, comments, and signatures.

üöÄ Features
. Upload and view PDFs
. Highlight text with customizable colors
. Underline important sections
. Add comments to specific parts of the document
. Draw signatures anywhere on the document
. Export the annotated PDF with all modifications embedded

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries Used
Library/Tool and	Reason for Use
Next.js 	Fast rendering and efficient routing
pdf-lib	To modify PDFs without external dependencies
TypeScript	Ensures type safety and better code maintainability
TailwindCSS	Provides a responsive and clean UI
React Hooks	For state management and component reactivity
‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced & Solutions
1Ô∏è‚É£ Embedding Annotations in the Exported PDF
Issue: pdf-lib doesn‚Äôt support direct annotation layers.

Solution: Used page.drawRectangle for highlights and underlines and page.drawText for comments.

2. Syncing Canvas Annotations with PDF Pages
Issue: Canvas overlay size didn‚Äôt match the PDF view.

Solution: Adjusted the canvas size dynamically using useEffect and setTimeout.

3. Handling Page Navigation with Annotations
Issue: Switching pages would remove existing annotations.

Solution: Stored annotations in a useRef object indexed by page number.

üí° Future Enhancements
. Text Selection-Based Annotations ‚Äì Instead of manual clicks, enable users to select text for highlights.Pen Tool for Freehand Drawing ‚Äì Allow freehand annotations beyond signatures.
. Collaboration Mode ‚Äì Multi-user annotations with real-time updates.
. Cloud Storage Integration ‚Äì Save and retrieve annotations from the cloud.
. Dark Mode Support ‚Äì Improve user experience with a theme toggle.
. Modularize my code and write comments
